# Random Expo CLI Development Server Crashes

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI development server crashes randomly without providing any clear error messages in the console. The issue is particularly challenging to debug because the crashes are inconsistent and difficult to reproduce.

## Bug Description

The Expo development server intermittently crashes without any apparent reason or error messages logged to the console. This makes identifying the root cause nearly impossible, as there is no clear indication of what triggered the crash.  The project is built using React Native.

## How to Reproduce

While there's no guaranteed way to reproduce this bug consistently, it is observed after running the project using `expo start`. The crash seems random and unrelated to specific code changes. 

## Potential Causes (Speculation)

* **Memory leaks:**  The Expo server might be experiencing memory leaks over time leading to crashes.
* **Resource contention:**  Potential resource contention (CPU, memory) might cause the server to become unstable.
* **Underlying Expo CLI issue:** It is possible that there's an underlying issue within the Expo CLI itself that can manifest as random crashes.

## Solution (If Found)

This is still under investigation. If a definitive solution is found, the `expoBugSolution.js` file will provide the solution.
