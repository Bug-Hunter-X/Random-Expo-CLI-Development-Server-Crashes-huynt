While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server would randomly crash without providing any clear error messages in the console. This made debugging extremely difficult, and the crashes were inconsistent, making it hard to reproduce reliably.  The project uses React Native, and the crashes seemed unrelated to any specific code changes, occurring even after a clean build.
