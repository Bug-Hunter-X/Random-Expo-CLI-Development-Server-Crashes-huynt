After extensive investigation, the issue turned out to be related to a combination of factors, including resource limitations on my machine. While there wasn't a specific code error, optimizing the app's performance and ensuring adequate resources for the development server significantly reduced the frequency of crashes. Here are some steps that helped:

1. **Increased System Resources:**  Ensuring enough free RAM and CPU was available significantly improved stability. This involved closing unnecessary applications and even upgrading system resources if needed.
2. **Reduced App Complexity:**  In the expoBug.js file, there was a function (or component) that took a lot of time to process. Refactoring this function, optimizing logic, and using more efficient data structures could dramatically improve performance. 
3. **Clean Build and Cache Clear:**  Running `expo start --clear` ensured that the server started with a fresh cache.
4. **Expo CLI Update:** Upgrading Expo CLI to the latest version resolved some underlying compatibility issues: `expo upgrade`
5. **Debugging with Remote Debugging and Profiler:** The React Native Debugger and the performance profiler can be utilized to identify bottlenecks in your app.

By addressing these areas, the random crashes of the Expo development server were significantly reduced.
